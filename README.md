Customer reviews on platforms like Yelp contain valuable feedback but are often too voluminous to read
manually. For restaurant owners and marketers, extracting insights from these reviews can inform
strategy – for example, improving menu offerings, service quality, or marketing. In fact, research shows
that “customer reviews are considered essential both in strategy development and consumer attraction”
and that analyzing them helps companies make decisions about product improvements, service recovery,
pricing, and customer retention. This project simulates a real-world business scenario: teams act as data
analytics consultants for a restaurant chain or city tourism board. Using text analytics on Yelp review
comments, students will uncover customer sentiment and themes to guide business decisions. Text
analysis is known to provide an “essential lens for understanding market trends, competitive landscapes,
and internal operational efficiencies”, so this project directly ties into business strategy by turning
unstructured review data into actionable intelligence.
